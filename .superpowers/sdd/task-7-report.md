# Task 7 Report — List entries, library, and title pages

## Status

Complete. Task 7 implements list-entry validation and persistence, catalog search/import, manual title creation, title detail tracking, and the authenticated library management view.

## Delivered

- Added `parseScore` with strict integer validation for scores 1–10 or `null`.
- Added media-aware entry normalization:
  - anime/series use episode progress;
  - movies omit numeric progress;
  - books/manga/comics use chapters or pages;
  - progress must be a non-negative integer.
- Added entry create/read/update/delete helpers and filtered/sorted library queries.
- Added the required server actions: `addToList`, `updateEntry`, `createManualWorkAction`, and `importHitAction`.
- Replaced `/` with a 300 ms debounced catalog search, type filtering, import cards, and manual creation.
- Added `/title/[id]` with work details and authenticated add/edit entry controls.
- Added authenticated `/library` with type/status filters, score/title/updated sorting, and quick edits.
- Added a shared application shell and focused media-card styling without implementing Task 8 theme/customization pages.

## Tests and verification

- TDD red/green cycle completed for `parseScore` and media progress normalization.
- `npm test`: 10 files passed, 54 tests passed.
- `npm run lint`: passed with no ESLint findings.
- `npm run build`: passed; `/`, `/library`, and `/title/[id]` compiled as dynamic routes.
- `git diff --check`: passed (Git only reported expected Windows LF→CRLF notices).

## Concerns / follow-up

- Real TMDB/Open Library responses were not manually exercised because provider credentials/network availability are environment-dependent; provider and cache unit tests remain green.
- Server-action validation errors currently use the framework error boundary rather than inline form messages; the validation itself is enforced server-side.
